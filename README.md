# Old Apply Page Clone
This project was aimed to practise using backgrounds and gradients (which are background images). The primary aim was to replicate the an old apple.com page's use of images and gradients as best as possible.

## How to run (local)
I likely won't create a github pages for this, but otherwise here's how to run it locally:
1. Clone this repo (`git clone git@github.com:qamk/old-apple-page-clone.git`)
2. Navigate into the folder (e.g. `cd old-apple-page-clone` or open the folder)
3. Open the `index.html` file (in your browser)

## Discussion
This project was a decent introduction to backgrounds and gradients. Backgrounds and gradients were a bit troublesome as it takes a lot more experimentation to acheive a certain effect, at least at this stage. Later I will learn more about design, so hopefully that process is smoother in the future.

I also endeavoured to use the `position` and `display` properties more deliberately to acheive my layout without relying on `flexbox`. I tried to use `float` sparingly and instead use `display: inline-block` in its place where applicable. Since the design of the page was relatively simple, this felt like a good opportunity to practise those skills.
